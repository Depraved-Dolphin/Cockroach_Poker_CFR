# Cockroach_Poker_CFR
This is an implementation of the counterfactual regret minimization algorithm to the game cockroach poker, basically using a bazooka to kill a fly

The counterfactual regret algorithm (CFR) has recently been developed and successfully optimized to solve and play the imperfect information game of poker, outcompeting top professionals in tournaments. However, no one has yet used this algorithm to solve Cockroach poker, a bluffing game similar to Bullshit but with stinkbugs and cockroaches. This project will attempt to do just that. Use state-of-the-art CFR algorithm and game theory to solve a two-player version of the game cockroach poker, basically using a bazooka to kill a fly.
